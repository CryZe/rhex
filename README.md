# rhex

## Introduction

Simple roguelike prototype written in [Rust][rust-home].

You can try it out by pointing your **ssh client** to: rhex [at] rhex.dpc.pw (password is obvious). Note: **Make sure your terminal supports 256 colors and exports `TERM=xterm-256color`!**

It's intendent to exercise my [Rust][rust-home] knowledge and let me play with
certain mechanisms that I'd like to see in roguelike game:

* hexagonal map
* tactical positioning (strafing, face-direction)

Previous iteration of this idea was/is: [Rustyhex][rustyhex] . This two project might merge into whole at some point.

This project is based on more general and useful: [hex2d-rs - Hexagonal grid map utillity library][hex2d-rs].

## Building

	git clone https://github.com/dpc/rhex.git
	cd rhex
	cargo build


## Status and goals

ATM. the game is just a working prototype. There's not much of gameplay yet.

Some core features that it already implements: simple AI, LoS, lighting, random map generation, areas, autoexplore command.

Core features that I'd like to add soon:

* sound (actions make noise that propagates)
* combat
* working stats
* stairs
* items/inventory
